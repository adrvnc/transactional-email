## My Process

### Built with 

- HTML5 
- Inline CSS & Media Queries 

### What I learned 

Before working on this project, I knew how to create horizontal lines. However,
I wasn't sure if I needed to do anything differently while developing emails. 
Using [Mark Robbins' Example](https://www.goodemailcode.com/email-code/hr) 
helped me be on the lookout for things I should be aware of. 

### Continued development

Learning to create emails from scratch   without using any framework can be beneficial. 
I plan on familiarizing myself with building responsive emails 
using the fluid hybrid approach. 

### Useful resources

- [Good Email Code](https://www.goodemailcode.com/) - A website created by Mark Robbins to highlight best email coding practices.
- [Simple Responsive HTML Email Tutorial](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/creating-a-simple-responsive-html-email--webdesign-12978) - Helped me understand how to create responsive emails using the "fluid hybrid" approach. I recommend it to use as a guide for anyone who is first starting out developing emails.
